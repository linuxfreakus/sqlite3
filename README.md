sqlite3
=======

cmake build of sqlite3 to make it easy to include as an external dependency when cross compiling libraries for various platforms/devices.

- extracted amalgamation sources from http://www.sqlite.org/download.html into /src
- added CMakeLists.txt with some options
- use the build.sh script to run stand-alone out of source build
